## Airbnb Clone Project

# Overview
This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb, built as part of my personal web development journey. The project focuses on replicating key features of Airbnb including property listings, detailed views, and booking functionality  all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.

As a frontend developer, my role in this project centers on building the user interface using modern web technologies, with an emphasis on accessibility, reusability, and mobile-first design.

## Project Structure (Planned)

# UI/UX Design Planning

Design Goals

The goal of the UI/UX design for this project is to build a clean, intuitive, and user-centered interface that mirrors the ease of use and visual appeal of Airbnb. As the frontend developer on this project, my focus is on ensuring smooth interaction, mobile responsiveness, and a visually consistent layout throughout the application.

# The main objectives are:

-Create an intuitive booking flow that feels natural for users.

-Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components.

-Ensure fast loading times and responsiveness on all screen sizes.

-Build accessible components that are easy to navigate.

-Follow a clean and modern design inspired by real-world booking platforms.

# Key Features to Implement

-A property search and filtering system (by location, date, and price).

-A responsive grid layout for listing properties.

-A detailed view for each listing with full descriptions, photos, and
booking form.

-A simple and secure checkout interface.

-A reusable component system for consistency and maintainability.

-A responsive navigation bar and footer.

-User-friendly form validation and confirmation feedback.

# Primary Pages

# Page Name & Description

Property Listing View: Displays available properties in a grid layout. Includes search and filter options. Designed to be responsive and accessible on all devices.

-Listing Detailed View: Provides in-depth information about a selected property, including high-quality images, pricing, host details, availability, and booking functionality.

-Simple Checkout View : A clean, focused page where users can review their booking details, enter simulated payment information, and confirm their reservation.

# Design Properties from Figma
Understanding and documenting design properties early helps ensure consistency throughout development. Below are the core visual styles used in this project, based on the Figma mockup.

# Color Styles
Primary Color: #FF5A5F – Used for main actions (like buttons and highlights)

Secondary Color: #008489 – Used for secondary buttons or links

Background Color: #FFFFFF – Used as the main page background

Primary Text Color: #222222 – For headlines and body text

Secondary Text Color: #717171 – For subheadings and muted content

# Typography
Font Family: Circular (or system fallback: sans-serif)

Headings:

Font Weight: Bold (700)

Font Size: 24px to 32px depending on the screen and heading level

Body Text:

Font Weight: Medium (500)

Font Size: 16px

Secondary Text:

Font Weight: Book/Regular (400)

Font Size: 14px

# Why Design Properties Matter
Identifying design properties like colors, typography, and spacing directly from a Figma mockup is essential for maintaining consistency across the application. These choices affect how users perceive and interact with the interface.
By clearly defining these styles upfront:
I can reuse them consistently in components (buttons, cards, headers, etc.).
It speeds up development and avoids visual inconsistencies.
It ensures the final product matches the intended design vision.
Understanding the Figma environment allows me to translate design into code more accurately, improving the user experience and visual quality of the application.
