# Airbnb Clone Project

Overview
This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb, built as part of my personal web development journey. The project focuses on replicating key features of Airbnb including property listings, detailed views, and booking functionality  all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.

As a frontend developer, my role in this project centers on building the user interface using modern web technologies, with an emphasis on accessibility, reusability, and mobile-first design.
